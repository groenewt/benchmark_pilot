But most of those weren't truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first.",29b9549d-23be-4811-a722-45a3017c4fda,essays_snowflake_arctic_embed2_568m

I learned this one from Joe Kraus. \[[3](#f3n)\] Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users. You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down. Pretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure.

That's one of California's hidden advantages: the mild climate means there's lots of marginal space. In cold places that margin gets trimmed off.
